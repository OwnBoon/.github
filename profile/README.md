# A Message to Our Developers

Thank you to all the developers for your amazing work on developing the OwnBoon app. Your contributions were truly invaluable, and we appreciate every single moment we had at OwnBoon. It was a fun and exciting journey.

Project Status
As of December 20, 2023, OwnBoon is no longer in business. This repository has been made public as an archive for reference purposes.

Reflections on Our Initial Challenges
Lack of a clear main identity or unique feature for our product
Slow development progress
Insufficient in-depth research experience
Project Hibernation
The project entered a long pause or hibernation phase before the decision to close operations.

We thank everyone who was part of this journey and contributed to the OwnBoon project.
